## Project setup


Introduction:

We are using the following technology stack:

- Angular.io + Nginx (Frontend)
- Postgresql (Database)
- Redis (Session)
- Spring boot (Backend)
- Docker

For development you need docker installed and working. As IDE we recommend Idea IntelliJ Ultimate.

Intellij is well suited for Angular and Spring boot development
